### Finding Research Software Engineers and Research Data Scientists

This project aims to identify Research Software Engineers and Research Data Scientists (some of whom are not formally called like that).

We explore diverse data sources:

* [Research Software Association WordPress Website](http://rse.ac.uk/)

* [Indeed.com](indeed.com) search for Research+Software+Engineer
  The indeed.com search focused on the US website (since the [web scraper code]() we used was designed for the us website and did not work automatically on indeed.co.uk). The search treated the key words independently, so the positions were quite diverse, but many were research engineers working in industry or software engineers working in research institutions. A lot of Data Science and Machine Learning jobs popped up without specifying these words explicitly.

* [http://www.jobs.ac.uk/](http://www.jobs.ac.uk/) search for Research + Software

* [University of Cambridge Website](www.cam.ac.uk)
